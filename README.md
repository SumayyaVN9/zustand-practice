 Zustand is a state management library for React (and Next.js).
 
👉 It is used to store and share data between components.

## 🤔 Why Zustand?

👉 Redux can feel big and complex.

👉 Zustand is small, simple, and easy.

✅ No reducers

✅ No actions

✅ Very less code

## 🧠 Simple idea

Think of Zustand like a small global store 🗃️

Any component can read or update data directly.
